But not a single bee has come near it yet. And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees out—or the bees keep the mice out, I don’t know which.’</p><p>‘I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,’ said Alice. ‘It isn’t very likely there would be any mice on the horse’s back.’</p><p>‘Not very likely, perhaps,’ said the Knight: ‘but if they <em>do</em> come, I don’t choose to have them running all about.’</p><p>‘You see,’ he went on after a pause, ‘it’s as well to be provided for <em>everything</em>. That’s the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet.’</p><p>‘But what are they for?’ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.</p></div> </div>
